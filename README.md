In this project,design of a simple memory game machine is considered.
Gamer is going to encounter 4 LED's that are blinking randomly for 5 to 7 times.
At the end of the sequential blinking process by the machine,gamer should press the buttons(num:4) that corresponds to 4 LED's.
Initially,system makes random assignments for four LED's and blinks them and buzz at the same time for 5 to 7 times.
When system stops blinking processes and buzzing, then gamer is expected to press buttons corresponding each LED's in correct sequence and order.
If the gamer presses to the wrong button,then the system would give no response to the user until the user restarts the game.
If the gamer presses to the correct button for his move,then all LED's blinks for 3 times and buzzer sounds for 3 times at the same time as victory message,then system remakes a game.


Area of Usage:This project can be used as a toy for kids to enhance their memory capabilities as virtually and audiotory.



Materials Used:LED,Button,Buzzer,Arduino Nano,Resistors.

Enhancement ideas:Implementation of IR remote controller instead of buttons. Adding 2 LED's to show user entered correct or not.
