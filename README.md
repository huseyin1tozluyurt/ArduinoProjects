In this project,design of a simple memory game machine is considered.
Gamer is going to encounter 4 LED's that are blinking randomly for 5 to 7 times.
At the end of the sequential blinking process by the machine,gamer should press the buttons(num:4) that corresponds to 4 LED's.
If the gamer presses to the wrong button,then the system restart game buzzing nothing except for the specific sound of each button that corresponds each led for 1 time.
If the gamer presses to the correct button for his move,then all LED's blinks for 3 times and buzzer sounds for 3 times at the same time as victory message,then system remakes a game.


Area of Usage:This project can be used as a toy for kids to enhance their memory capabilities as virtually and audiotory.



Materials Used:LED,Button,Buzzer,Arduino Nano,Resistors.

Enhancement ideas:Implementation of IR remote controller instead of buttons.
